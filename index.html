	<h1>New Lawsuit Against UPS Brings Wage Theft to the Forefront</h1>

	</div>

	<h4>The lawsuit is the largest wage theft lawsuit against a delivery company in New York State, highlighting the precarity of seasonal workers during the busiest time for commerce.</h4>

	<h4>NINAR TAHA</h4>
	<h5>December 17, 2025</h5>

	<p>Earlier this week, New York Attorney General Leticia James filed a lawsuit against United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), for allegedly stealing seasonal workers’ wages. This is one of the largest lawsuits against wage theft since Governor Kathy Hochul established the Wage Theft Task Force in 2022. 

	The lawsuit claims that UPS’s inconsistent timekeeping practices cause seasonal delivery workers to be persistently shorted for time worked at the beginning and end of their shifts. 

	Wage theft has been a longstanding issue across New York City. Over 130,000 claims have been filed against businesses across the city since 2012, according to New York State Department of Labor data.

Guatemala’s red line starts near zero in 2000 and climbs steeply to $21.65 billion by 2024, far above the others. Honduras’s orange line increases from around $2 billion in 2000 to $9.53 billion in 2024, while El Salvador’s brown line rises from roughly $2 billion to $8.49 billion over the same period. The chart notes that values are based on 2024 data in current US dollars. The data source is the World Bank." /></noscript></div>

		<p>According to Amir Khafegy, Senior Labor Reporter at Documented, which manages the city Wage Theft Monitor, says the Department of Labor can assist workers to collect unpaid wages, however, “this process is often drawn out, and investigations can take up to several years.”
