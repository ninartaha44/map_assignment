	<p>Earlier this week, New York Attorney General Leticia James filed a lawsuit against United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), for allegedly stealing seasonal workers’ wages. This is one of the largest lawsuits against wage theft since Governor Kathy Hochul established the <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-major-crackdown-combat-wage-theft">Wage Theft Task Force</a> in 2022.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/new-york-v-united-parcel-service-inc-complaint-2025.pdf">lawsuit</a> claims that UPS’s inconsistent timekeeping practices cause seasonal delivery workers to be persistently shorted for time worked at the beginning and end of their shifts.</p>

	<p>Wage theft has been a longstanding issue across New York City. Over 130,000 claims have been filed against businesses across the city since 2012, according to New York State Department of Labor data.

		<p>According to Amir Khafegy, Senior Labor Reporter at Documented, which manages the city <a href="https://www.nywagetheft.com/">Wage Theft Monitor</a>, the Department of Labor can assist workers to collect unpaid wages, however, “this process is often drawn out, and investigations can take up to several years.”
